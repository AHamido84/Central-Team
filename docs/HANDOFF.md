# Handoff — state of the project

Last updated: 2026-09-28 · Branch: `claude/modest-faraday-3u6pzy` · Read with `CLAUDE.md` (rules) and `docs/ROADMAP.md` (next work).

## Where we are

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 0 — Foundation | **Built.** Auth (password, magic link, reset, email change), invitations, onboarding, RBAC with permission matrix + overrides, departments, feature flags, audit log, notifications, design system, AR/EN RTL/LTR, light/dark |
| 1 — Client Portal | **Built.** Agency client management (clients, portal users, packages + usage ledger, files, messages inbox) and the client portal (home, files, messages, company settings, flag-guarded Requests/Approvals/Calendar) |
| 2 — Requests | **Next.** Nothing started |

Verified green on a fresh seed: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm i18n:check`, 44 unit tests, 36 RLS tests,
13 Playwright e2e tests, `pnpm build`. The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is written but has not run on GitHub yet.

## Run it

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh     # deps, Docker, local Supabase, .env.local, migrations + seed
pnpm dev                      # http://localhost:3000 — every seed password is Passw0rd!
```

Key accounts: `sara@ofoq.test` (Super Admin), `faisal@ofoq.test` (Admin), `noura@ofoq.test` (Account Manager),
`khalid@ofoq.test` (Specialist), `mohammed@najd.test` (Client Owner), `abeer@najd.test` (Client Member),
`saad@najd.test` (Client Viewer). Full table in `README.md`.

## How the code is organized (quick map)

- `supabase/migrations/` — `…183222_initial_schema.sql` (drizzle-kit generated from `src/**/db/schema.ts`),
  `…183300_app_functions.sql` (permission functions, guards/triggers, audit, auth hook),
  `…183400_rls_policies.sql`, `…183500_reference_data.sql` (permission catalog, flags, `app.bootstrap_organization`, buckets).
  New tables: edit Drizzle schema → `pnpm db:generate` → add a hand-written SQL migration for RLS/triggers.
- `src/lib/` — `db/rls.ts` (`withRls`), `actions/define-action.ts` (every mutation), `auth/context.ts`
  (`requireAgency` / `requirePortal`), `events/`, `email/`, `i18n/`, `storage.ts`, `permissions/`.
- `src/modules/<module>/` — `db/schema.ts`, `server/{queries,actions}.ts`, `components/`, `constants.ts`.
- `messages/{ar,en}/<namespace>.json` — typed keys (Arabic is the source of truth); `pnpm i18n:check` enforces parity.
- Tests: `tests/unit`, `tests/db` (RLS as each persona, rolled back), `e2e/` (Playwright + Mailpit).

## Gotchas learned the hard way

1. **Realtime**: call `ensureRealtimeAuth()` before subscribing, or the join is validated as `anon` and rejected (ADR-024).
2. **`'use server'` files** may export only async functions — put constants in `constants.ts`.
3. **SQL subqueries in Drizzle `select`** must reference the outer table literally (`threads.id`), not `${threads.id}`
   (which renders unqualified and becomes ambiguous).
4. **Policies with subqueries** must qualify outer columns (`packages.id`), or they bind to the inner table.
5. **Mixed-direction text**: wrap names/files in `<bdi>` or use `t.rich` with `<b>`; quoted placeholders in messages
   use Unicode isolates (U+2068/U+2069).
6. **Tests depend on seed data**: run `pnpm db:reset` before `pnpm test:db`; e2e creates unique users and is re-runnable.
7. Sandboxes may block ghcr/ECR image pulls — `bootstrap.sh` falls back to Docker Hub.
8. Dev-only: the Next.js dev indicator ("N" bubble) overlaps the bottom-left of mobile screenshots; it is not in builds.

## Open items (need the owner)

- Answers to open questions in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (brand, logo, domain, sending email, data residency/PDPL).
- Staging deploy on Vercel + Supabase Cloud with a custom domain; Resend domain verification; production GoTrue SMTP.
- Full human QA pass (AR/EN × light/dark × mobile/desktop) on every screen.
- Event dispatcher (consumers of `domain_events`) — planned with Phase 2; notifications are currently sent inline after commit.

## Suggested Phase 2 scope (from the roadmap)

Dynamic request forms (versioned JSON definitions), client request submission from the portal, request lifecycle
and statuses, agency triage inbox (assign, prioritize, convert later to tasks), SLA timer groundwork, and turning on
`module.requests` so the portal "Active requests" slot and `/portal/requests` become live. Reuse `threads`
(`subject_type = 'request'`) for request conversations and `files` for attachments.
